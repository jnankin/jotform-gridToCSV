Takes a jotform grid report url and converts it to a csv.  
Had to do this because of a bug where I couldnt get products that were purchased with stripe to output in the reports.  Jotform has no ETA on when to fix this.

git clone https://github.com/jnankin/jotform-gridToCSV.git
cd jotform-gridToCSV.git
composer update

Requires
========
PHP 5.3+
